This project involves developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict IMDb ratings based on movie attributes. The dataset is merged from two sources: credits.csv and titles.csv. The ANN model is trained on scaled features, and its performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Visualizations are used to illustrate training loss and predicted vs. actual ratings. The goal is to uncover hidden trends and improve prediction accuracy, providing insights for content optimization strategies in the streaming industry. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning in film analysis.
